"""This provides useful general functions for working with lists (OBSOLETE).

This module and its C code equivalent are considered to be obsolete, and
are likely to be deprecated in a future release of Biopython, before being
removed.  Please get in touch via the mailing list if this will affect you.
Many of these functions can be avoided using the python set object.

Functions:
asdict        Make the list into a dictionary (for fast testing of membership).
items         Get one of each item in a list.
count         Count the number of times each item appears.
contents      Calculate percentage each item appears in a list.
itemindex     Make an index of the items in the list.
intersection  Get the items in common between 2 lists.
difference    Get the items in 1 list, but not the other.
indexesof     Get a list of the indexes of some items in a list.
take          Take some items from a list.
