"""Parser for XML results returned by NCBI's Entrez Utilities. This
parser is used by the read() function in Bio.Entrez, and is not intended
be used directly.
"""

# The question is how to represent an XML file as Python objects. Some
# XML files returned by NCBI look like lists, others look like dictionaries,
# and others look like a mix of lists and dictionaries.
#
# My approach is to classify each possible element in the XML as a plain
# string, an integer, a list, a dictionary, or a structure. The latter is a
# dictionary where the same key can occur multiple times; in Python, it is
# represented as a dictionary where that key occurs once, pointing to a list
# of values found in the XML file.
#
# The parser then goes through the XML and creates the appropriate Python
# object for each element. The different levels encountered in the XML are
# preserved on the Python side. So a subelement of a subelement of an element
# is a value in a dictionary that is stored in a list which is a value in
# some other dictionary (or a value in a list which itself belongs to a list
# which is a value in a dictionary, and so on). Attributes encountered in 
# the XML are stored as a dictionary in a member .attributes of each element,
# and the tag name is saved in a member .tag.
#
# To decide which kind of Python object corresponds to each element in the
# XML, the parser analyzes the DTD referred at the top of (almost) every
# XML file returned by the Entrez Utilities. This is preferred over a hand-
# written solution, since the number of DTDs is rather large and their
# contents may change over time. About half the code in this parser deals
# wih parsing the DTD, and the other half with the XML itself.
#
# One type of query (EFetch on the Journals database) returns an XML without
# an associated DTD. These files are handled using the hand-written
# SerialSet.py
