        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.
        
        It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
        such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
        source code. Highlights are:
        
        * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
        * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
        * support for new languages and formats are added easily
        * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG and ANSI sequences
        * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
        * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!
        
        The `Pygments tip`_ is installable with ``easy_install Pygments==dev``.
