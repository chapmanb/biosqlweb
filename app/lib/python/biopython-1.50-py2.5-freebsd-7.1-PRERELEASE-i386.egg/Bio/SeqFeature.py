"""Represent a Sequence Feature holding info about a part of a sequence.

This is heavily modeled after the Biocorba SeqFeature objects, and
may be pretty biased towards GenBank stuff since I'm writing it
for the GenBank parser output...

What's here:

Base class to hold a Feature.
----------------------------
classes:
o SeqFeature

Hold information about a Reference.
----------------------------------

This is an attempt to create a General class to hold Reference type
information.

classes:
o Reference

Specify locations of a feature on a Sequence.
---------------------------------------------

This aims to handle, in Ewan's words, 'the dreaded fuzziness issue' in
much the same way as Biocorba. This has the advantages of allowing us
to handle fuzzy stuff in case anyone needs it, and also be compatible
with Biocorba.

classes:
o FeatureLocation - Specify the start and end location of a feature.

o ExactPosition - Specify the position as being exact.
o WithinPosition - Specify a position occuring within some range.
o BetweenPosition - Specify a position occuring between a range.
o BeforePosition - Specify the position as being found before some base.
o AfterPosition - Specify the position as being found after some base.
"""

class SeqFeature:
    """Represent a Sequence Feature on an object.

    Attributes:
    o location - the location of the feature on the sequence
    o type - the specified type of the feature (ie. CDS, exon, repeat...)
    o location_operator - a string specifying how this SeqFeature may
    be related to others. For example, in the example GenBank feature
    shown below, the location_operator would be "join"
    o strand - A value specifying on which strand (of a DNA sequence, for
    instance) the feature deals with. 1 indicates the plus strand, -1 
    indicates the minus strand, 0 indicates both strands, and None indicates
    that strand doesn't apply (ie. for proteins) or is not known.
    o id - A string identifier for the feature.
    o ref - A reference to another sequence. This could be an accession
    number for some different sequence.
    o ref_db - A different database for the reference accession number.
    o qualifier - A dictionary of qualifiers on the feature. These are
    analagous to the qualifiers from a GenBank feature table. The keys of
    the dictionary are qualifier names, the values are the qualifier
    values.
    o sub_features - Additional SeqFeatures which fall under this 'parent'
    feature. For instance, if we having something like:

    CDS    join(1..10,30..40,50..60)

    The the top level feature would be a CDS from 1 to 60, and the sub
    features would be of 'CDS_join' type and would be from 1 to 10, 30 to
    40 and 50 to 60, respectively.
