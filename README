This is a Google App Engine implementation of the BioSQL database model 
(http://www.biosql.org/wiki/Main_Page) for storing biological sequences
and features and annotations on them.

This is a demonstration of advancing the BioSQL data model to readily
deployed resources.

The code includes the Biopython library and the mako template language for
generating HTML. For client javascript, jQuery and jQueryUI are also included.

The demonstration server is running at:
